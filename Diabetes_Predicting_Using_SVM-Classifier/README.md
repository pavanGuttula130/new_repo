# Diabetes_Predecting_Using_SVM_and_StreamLit
### Diabetes of person can be predicted by taking some information or features.
### Features are:
     1) Pregnancies	
     2) Glucose
     3) BloodPressure
     4) SkinThickness
     5) Insulin
     6) BMI
     7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction
     8) Age
### Taking these features and feeding to machine learning algorthim like support vector machine (SVM) 
### Training the model and saving the model as .sav file using python package pickle
### To Install Pickle
    pip install pickle
### Created web like interface using Streamlit for user to enter data
